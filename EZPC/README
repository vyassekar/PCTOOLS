All you need to do is run wrapper

perl ezpc_wrapper.pl anonymized_input.tsv TEST 60 70


--> anonymized_input.tsv is what i expect you will get from your google doc?

TEST is just a suffix i used for tracking version/when i ran it

60 is minpcsize 70 is maxpcsize

prereqs to run:
	dos2unix
	glpsol (via glpk)
